# WorkbenchServer
Manage Workbench execution in business environments.

## Installation
1. Install python3 with pip (in Debian 9 is `apt install python3-pip`).
2. Install lib-usb or openUSB (in Debian 9 is `apt install libusb-1.0-0`)
3. Clone WorkbenchServer: `git clone https://github.com/ereuse/workbench-server && cd workbench-server`.
4. Install WorkbenchServer: `pip3 install -e . -r requirements.txt`.

You will probably want to install the WorkbenchServerClient to be able to manage
WorkbenchServer in an easy way.

In Debian, you will need to set an *udeb* rule in order to be able to read USB information without granting
root permissions to WorkbenchServer. Perform as follows with *root*, where `user-group` is the group where the user
executing WorkbenchServer is: 
`echo 'ï»¿SUBSYSTEM=="usb", MODE="0666", GROUP="user-group"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-workbench.rules` and reboot.

## Testing

### An app.py
```python
from pathlib import Path

from workbench_server.flaskapp import WorkbenchServer

app = WorkbenchServer()
# You will need certificates if you want to serve through HTTPS
# To generate certificates see https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/running-your-flask-application-over-https
directory = Path(__file__).parent
ssl = str(directory.joinpath('cert.pem')), str(directory.joinpath('key.pem'))
app.run('0.0.0.0', 8091, threaded=True, ssl_context=ssl, use_reloader=False)
```
